# Testing Chat Endpoints

Once you have defined your chat endpoints, you can send queries to them through the Genkit Developer UI or by running your own server.

## Running Your Own Server

Once, you have the server running, you can send queries to your chat endpoints using a tool like `curl` or Postman.

For an example, check [Getting Started - Usage](/getting-started#usage)

## Genkit Developer UI

You could also start the Genkit Developer UI instead of running your own server for testing, using the following command:

```bash copy
genkit start
```

OR (if you haven't installed Genkit CLI globally)

```bash copy
npx genkit start
```

For more information on how to install the Firebase Genkit CLI, please check the [Genkit CLI documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit/get-started).

Once you have the Genkit Developer UI loaded in your browser, you should be able to see your defined chat endpoints under the **Flows** section in the left sidebar. Simply click on the endpoint you want to test and enter the query you want to test with. Clicking the **Run** button will send the query to the endpoint and the response generation process will start.

The below image shows a sample of the Genkit Developer UI:
