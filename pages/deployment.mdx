# Deployment

Thanks to [Firebase Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit), deploying your chat endpoints is as simple as running a single command.

You can deploy your QvikChat project to any Node.js platform that can serve an [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) app, whether it is a cloud service or your own server.

When you are ready to deploy the server to serve your defined chat endpoints, simply **build** the project and execute the **start** command.

```bash copy
npm run build
npm run start
```

## QvikChat Sarter Template

If you are using the [QvikChat Starter Template](https://github.com/oconva/qvikchat-starter-template), you can also run the commands for linting and code formatting before deploying the server.

```bash copy
npm run lint
npm run format
```

If you've configured the tests correctly, you can also run the tests before deploying the server.

```bash copy
npm run test
```
