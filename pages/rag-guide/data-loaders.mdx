# Data Loaders

Out of the box, QvikChat provides support for loading data from text, PDF, JSON, CSV, or a code of a supported programming language. However, if you want to load a file not supported by QvikChat by default, you can simply provide an instance of any [LangChain-supported data loader](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/document_loaders) as the `dataLoader` parameter to the `retrieverConfig` or in the configurations parameters of the `getDataRetriever` method.
