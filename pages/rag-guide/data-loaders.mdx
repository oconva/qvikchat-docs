# Data Loaders

QvikChat provides built-in support for loading data from text, PDF, JSON, CSV, or a code file of a supported programming language. However, if you want to load a file not supported by QvikChat by default, you can simply use any [LangChain-supported data loader](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/document_loaders) to load the data and provide the documents as the `docs` property when configuring the retriever. Check [Loading Custom Data](#loading-custom-data) for more information.

## Built-in Data Loaders

QvikChat provides built-in support for loading data from the following file types:

- **Text files:** Any documents containing text data, plus any code files of supported programming languages.
- **PDF files:** Can use the `pdfLoaderOptions` to specify additional options.
- **JSON and JSONLines files:** Can use the `jsonLoaderKeysToInclude` property to specify the keys containing relevant data.
- **CSV files:** Can use the `csvLoaderOptions` property to specify the delimiter and other options.

The type of data you are providing is inferred from the file extension given in the `filePath` value that you provide when configuring the retriever. For information on configuring the retriever, see the [Retriever Configuration](/rag-guide/data-retrieval) page.

## Data Splitting

Data in the given file is first loaded into processable `Document` objects, and is then split into smaller chunks using a chunking strategy. This is important for two reasons: (1) it makes it easier to index data, and (2) it makes it easier to query data. Furthermore, since most LLM models have a finite context window (or input size), having smaller chunks of data ensures relevant context information isn't lost.

The chunking strategy used can have a signigicant impact on the performance of a chat service that responds to queries based on the data. However, since data comes in all shapes and sizes, it is recommended to experiment with different configurations to find the best one for your use case. There are, however, some default configurations that can be used, for example, for CSV data each row (or line) can be a chunk. If not sure, start with the default configurations and then experiment with different configurations.

You can use the `chunkingConfig` property to specify the data chunking configuration when configuring the retriever. The `chunkingConfig` object can contain the following properties:

- `chunkSize`: The size of each chunk in the data. The default value is 1000.
- `overlap`: The number of tokens to overlap between chunks. The default value is 200.

Here is an example of how you can specify the data chunking configuration:

```typescript
import { defineChatEndpoint } from "@oconva/qvikchat/endpoints";

// endpoint with custom chunking configurations
defineChatEndpoint({
  endpoint: "rag",
  enableRAG: true,
  topic: "Test",
  retrieverConfig: {
    filePath: "src/data/knowledge-bases/test-data.csv",
    generateEmbeddings: true,
    chunkingConfig: {
      chunkSize: 500,
      chunkOverlap: 50,
    },
  },
});
```

## Data Loading Options

You can specify data loading options through the retriever configurations object when called the `getDataRetriever` method or the when specifying the `retrieverConfig` property in the chat endpoint configuration. For more information, check [Retriever Config](/data-retrieval#retriever-config).

## Loading Custom Data

When you want to load data from a file that is not supported by QvikChat out of the box, you can use any [LangChain-supported data loader](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/document_loaders) to load the data and provide the documents as the `docs` property when configuring the retriever. 

### Example - Loading Data from Webpage

Here is an example of how you can load data from a webpage using the `htmlLoader` from LangChain:

```typescript
