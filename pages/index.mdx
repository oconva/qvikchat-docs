Develop a self-hosted production-ready AI-powered chat app or service at a rapid pace
with this [Firebase Genkit](https://github.com/firebase/genkit) and
[LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) based framework.

**QvikChat** is a framework that provides you with a solid foundation to build powerful AI-powered chat service endpoints quickly and efficiently. It includes support for **multiple types of conversations (open-ended, close-ended)**, **chat history**, **response caching**, **authentication**, and **information retrieval using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).**

<Notice>
  Note: This is not an official Firebase Genkit or LangChain framework. This is
  a community-driven project. Firebase Genkit is currently in beta, this means
  that the public API and framework design may change in backward-incompatible
  ways. We will do our best to keep this project up-to-date.

## Features

- **Firebase Genkit**: Built using the open source [Firebase Genkit framework](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) to help you build powerful production-ready AI-powered apps or services quickly and efficiently.
- **Deploy to any NodeJS platform**: Deploy your app or service to any NodeJS platform, including Firebase, Google Cloud, AWS, Heroku, etc.
- **LangChain**: Built using the open source [LangChain framework](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) to help you process data for RAG and information retrieval. Easily extend the framework by using any LangChain supported embedding model, vector store, data loader, and more.
- **Dotprompt**: Using [Dotprompt](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit/dotprompt) for well-structured prompts with all relevant metadata and input-output data validation.
- **Firebase Firestore**: In-built support for using [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) as chat history store, cache store, and API key store.
- **Chat agents**: Create chat agents with support for chat history, caching, authentication and information retrieval, in a few lines of code.
- **API key protected endpoints**: API Key Store to easily manage API keys and ensure that only authorized users can access your app endpoints.
- **Response Caching**: Cache responses to user queries to improve response times and reduce the number of API calls to LLM.
- **RAG Agents**: Create chat agents that can use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer user queries by retrieving additional context information (e.g. from a text or JSON file).
- **RAG Data Loading**: Built-in support for loading text, JSON, PDF, or code files. Easily add new knowledge bases to create new RAG agents.
- **Focus on Safety, Reliablity and Efficiency**: Every component is built with a focus on ensuring safety, reliability and efficiency. From using prompts that help mitigate LLM hallucination and deter prompt injection attacks, to providing in-built support for enabling authentication for each endpoint, QvikChat is designed to help you build secure, performant and reliable chat apps and services.

## Notes

This is a minimalistic extensible framework. Its meant to give you a **starting point** so you can quickly get started with building your chat app or service using Genkit, eliminating the need for you to deal with setting up the whole project from scratch.

This means that this framework is not exhaustive, and you may add more features, chat agent types, cloud-based database support, etc. as you see fit. Since, it is built on top of Genkit and LangChain, you can easily add more models, chat history stores, vector stores and more.
