## Genkit Developer UI

You could also start the Genkit Developer UI instead of running your own server for testing, using the following command:

```bash copy
genkit start
```

OR (if you haven't installed Genkit CLI globally)

```bash copy
npx genkit start
```

For more information on how to install the Firebase Genkit CLI, please check the [Genkit CLI documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit/get-started).
